#### Beanie is an asynchronous object-document mapper (ODM) for MongoDB, which supports data and schema migrations out-of-the-box. It uses Motor, as an asynchronous database engine, and Pydantic. While you could simply use Motor, Beanie provides an additional abstraction layer, making it much easier to interact with collections inside a Mongo database.
